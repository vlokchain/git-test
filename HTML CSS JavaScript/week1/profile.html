    About Me
    </h2>
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    I was born in Mexico City, Mexico and left the country with my parents when I was about 7 years old.
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Currently I reside in Manhattan, New York and it's been quite the journey. I like it here but crime is getting a <strong>little</strong> out of hand haha.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    I majored in Mechanical Engineering at
    <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/engineering">CCNY</a>
    and althought it was exhausting I loved every minute of it.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    I don't have any experience coding but I'm very involved heavily with excel and the commands work very similar to elements in HTML.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    My main goal in life is to provide job placement and provide legal counsel for low income families in disporportionaly affected neighborhoods.

    Soccer! I live and breate it. <em>*inhales*</em> I can't get enought of it. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Camping and hiking! There's nothing else I rather do than get a fresh breather up in the mountains.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    Repairing all things tech! I love repairing new and old broken gadgets. If it runs on electricity, has a circuit board and doesn't power on my handy little microscope and nano soldering machine will get the job done!
