# 1. Linear Search:
"""
    Is the most basic easy to understand search algorithm while not the most efficient it is still
    useful because it can be used on any data set regardless of whether the items are sorted or not
"""
# 2. Binary Search:
"""
    A much more efficient algorithm the trade-off is that it only works on sorted data
"""

# THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SORTS: BUBBLE AND QUICK

# 3. Bubble sort
"""
    Implements the brute force technique and is thus less efficient
"""
# 4. Quick Sort:
"""
    Implements the divide and conquer technique and is thus more efficient making it one of the most popular sorting algorithms
"""

# LINEAR SEARCH TRADEOFFS


# 1. Benefits:
"""
    Linear seatch will always work, no matter whether items are sorted or unsorted.
"""

# 3. Disadvatanges:
"""
    Slows as the number of items increase in the data set.
    Will examine every value even if the value is not in the data set.
    Binary search is faster, but requires items to be sorted.
    Linear search is more useful on small unsorted data sets.
