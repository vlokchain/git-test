The voice in videos should be constant throughout.
It is easy to be thrown off or disengage from the course when the voice of the material changes.
I found the voice of Todd Sparrow to be the most effective and easiest to focus and listen to.
It carries basic emotion and sounds very human like so it easy to listen to and engage with.
The voice of Minae Lee lacks emotion, sounds very robotic and is sometimes hard to understand when uncommon words are spoken like "boolean attributes,"
this is when I need to activate subtitles to understand what is being said.

In Week 1:
Python Fundamentals > Week 1: Bootcamp Kick-Off & Introduction to Python > Introduction to Python Programming > 3. Variables and Data Types
DEFINITION = Unordered collection of key-value pairs

In Week 3:
Python Fundamentals > Week 3: Introduction to Data Structures > Dictionaries > 1. Introduction to Dictionaries

Enabling a comments section on course video lessons (not neccesarily original youtube comments) but comments that will be native to course video lessons.
I understand having all feedback on questions on Slack is imensely benificial because all data is found in one source but there have been plenty of times where
I felt like leaving a comment regarding a question or self knowledge on the topic or even tips and tricks. Havinng the answer to the problem at the source of origin
could prove very useful for students. I'll admit lots of times I've ditched a slack "search" or "post" for feedback or solution and have therefore skipped to the next
course video.
